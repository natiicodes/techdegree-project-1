            <img src="images/Vallejo.map.jpg" alt="A Map of were vallejo, ca is">
            <p> I am a proud wife, and mother to three amazing kids. I have two boys and one girl. All under the age of six years old. i was born and raised in Vallejo, CA.  My Husband's is in IT and had told me about programming a couple years back, I knew i wanted to change my career but just didnt know to what. So that when he brought up programming. I rememberd how cool it was to change my myspace and add music, so i did a free HTML class on my own. I fell in love. Unfortunately after about a week I had to go back to work.
            Fast forward to now, being a stay at home mom has given me the oppurtonity to get back to something I had fell in love with years ago. and I didnt know I can make my full time job. Even though im still new in the sense I have found something that I not only found a passion for but that I can do for the rest of my life.
