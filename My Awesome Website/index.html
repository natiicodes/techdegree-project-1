          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p> I stated programming when I had myspace. but didnt know it could be a full time thing. I was only doing it to keep up with new features it had at the time. </p>
          <p> A couple years after high school I became a CNA Certified Nurses Assistant for about seven years, once I meet my husband I became a stay at home mom after our secound child was born. </p>
          <p> Had my third child and now its time to do something I loved for so long but didnt know it and I am excited to learn and get back in the work force in the near future.  .</p>
